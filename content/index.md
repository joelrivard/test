Most things happen somewhere, and mapping can be an effective technique for exploring, analysing, and presenting many types of data. This interactive workshop is designed for researchers who are interested in adding a spatial dimension to their research.

In this 12-hour workshop, participants will be introduced to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques from a humanist’s perspective. Starting from primary sources, participants will learn how to extract spatial “clues” from many types of primary sources, create and manipulate GIS-friendly data, transform addresses and place names into coordinates and web maps and use georeferencing techniques to bring digitized historical maps into GIS software.

The [first iteration](http://ssimpkin.github.io/dhsite2017) of this workshop was presented at [Digital Humanities Summer Institute: Technologies East (DHSITE)](https://dhsite.org/) in Ottawa on May 17-18, 2017. Feedback is welcome!
