## What is GIS?

GIS stands for Geographic Information Systems (or Sciences), and refers to the software and techniques used to view, analyse, create, and modify geographic data. Weâ€™ll be using some GIS terminology and techniques for this workshop. 

## Common data types

GIS data comes in two major types: raster and vector.

Vector data consists of points, lines and polygons, and is most commonly used to represent discrete objects such as boundary lines, roads, building outlines, points of interest, etc. The file formats typically used for vector data are Esri shapefiles (.shp), Keyhole Markup Language files (.kmz or .kml, commonly found in Google Earth), GeoJSON, and even tabular data like Comma Separated Values (.csv).

Raster data represents data as a grid of values, and is most commonly used to represent continuous data such as elevation, satellite imagery, watershed depths, precipitation, scanned analog maps, etc. The file formats are similar to those of images (GeoTIFF, JPEG, etc.). In web maps, raster data is sometimes split into smaller tiles, hosted on a server, and brought into the map as an overlay.

In this workshop, we'll be using scanned fire insurance plans (raster) as a starting point, and then creating point and polygon layers (vector) to show historical businesses.
