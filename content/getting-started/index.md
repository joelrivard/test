## Workshop structure

The workshop is divided into four sections.

In part one, we'll discuss existing humanities GIS projects and the software required to work with geospatial data. We’ll learn more about the properties of geospatial data and some common formats you may encounter. We'll install QGIS, an open-source desktop GIS package that works with Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems. 


In part two, we’ll take a look at how analog maps can be brought into the digital world through georeferencing and digitization. We'll use the georeferencing tools in QGIS to align historical maps with contemporary data, and then vectorize information found on the historical maps through tracing.

In part three, we’ll extract geospatial data clues from historical sources (in this case, a city directory), build a data table with attribute information in [Google Sheets](http://sheets.google.com) or Microsoft Excel, and use the geocoding tools in QGIS to match the addresses with coordinates in order to add additional data to our map.

Finally, in part four we'll discuss resources for finding existing geospatial data, as well as tips for producing legible and attractive maps. If there's time, we'll also demonstrate online mapping tools.


## Theme

Since [Digital Humanities Summer Institute: Technologies East (DHSITE)](https://dhsite.org/) is based in Ottawa, we’ve chosen to use historical data from this city in the tutorial exercises. Special thanks to Library and Archives Canada and the GSG Centre at the University of Ottawa for these materials.
